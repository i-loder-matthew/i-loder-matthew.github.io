      <p>I'm an aspiring linguist, and a recent graduate from Rutgers University with a B.A. in Linguistics. There's about a million reasons I love Linguistics. I love languages. I love puzzles. I love solving problems. And as a linguist, I get to focus on all of that. In particular, I'm interested in claims that our linguistic theories are meant to represent cognitive reality. While I like the idea, I'm not always sure it passes muster. I care about the cognitive and biological mechanisms of language. As a young almost-linguist, I am excited to explore how tools from different fields (computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, neuroscience) can be put to the test to make discoveries about the nature of language in the mind. Within syntax, in particular, I'm eager to see how we can use various sorts of empirical data (yes judgements, but also processing data, or information about neurological localization) in order to refine our grammatical theories, with the aim of achieving greater explanatory adequacy.</p>

      <p>When I'm not thinking about languages or Linguistics, you can catch me reading, writing, knitting, or thinking about urban planning and transit justice. And sometimes, but not in the epoch of Ol' Rona, you can spot me traveling the globe (as often as I can afford it).</p>
