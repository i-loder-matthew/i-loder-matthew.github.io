I'm a senior at Rutgers University who is just on the cusp of graduation. While here, I studied Linguistics, with minors in Spanish in Philosophy. I have had an incredible time at school and am so excited to have learned so much about not just my studies, but also about how to be a better person, researcher and traveller.

My research in the past has focused on French, working in the Comparative and Experimental Linguistics Lab with Dr. Viviane DÃ©prez. I've worked on projects related to French *wh*-questions, as well as the disambiguation of sentences with multiple negation words. I have also done work at Stanford as part of the Center for the Study of Language and Information Summer
